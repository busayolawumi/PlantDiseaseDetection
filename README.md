# PlantDiseaseDetection

## Automated Tomato Plant Leaf Disease Detection using Inception-ResNet-v2

This project leverages the power of deep learning, specifically the Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture, to automatically detect and classify diseases in tomato plant leaves. The system aims to aid farmers and agricultural experts in identifying plant diseases early, thereby improving crop management and yield.

### Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes the advanced Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture for high accuracy in image recognition tasks.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances model robustness by applying various transformations to the training dataset.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Trained on a meticulously curated dataset of tomato leaf images, covering multiple disease classes.
